# Project and Task Management Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the project and task management features for the Blurr HR Portal. These features allow users to create and manage projects, create tasks within those projects, assign tasks to employees, and visualize tasks in different views including a Kanban board.

## Features Implemented

1. **Project Management**

   - CRUD operations for projects
   - Project listing page
   - Project details page
   - Project form for creation and editing

2. **Task Management**
   - CRUD operations for tasks
   - Task assignment to employees
   - Task status and priority management
   - Task listing within projects
   - Kanban board view for visual task management

## Technical Implementation

### Server Actions

We implemented the following server actions for project and task management:

#### Project Actions

- `createProject`: Creates a new project for the current user
- `updateProject`: Updates an existing project with validation
- `deleteProject`: Deletes a project and its associated tasks
- `getProjects`: Retrieves all projects for the current user
- `getProject`: Retrieves a single project with its tasks

#### Task Actions

- `createTask`: Creates a new task for a specific project
- `updateTask`: Updates an existing task with validation
- `deleteTask`: Deletes a task
- `getTasks`: Retrieves all tasks across projects for the current user
- `updateTaskStatus`: Updates the status of a task (used for Kanban board drag-and-drop)

### UI Components

We created the following UI components for project and task management:

#### Project Components

- `ProjectCard`: Displays a project card in the projects list
- `ProjectsEmptyState`: Shows a message when no projects exist
- `ProjectForm`: Form for creating and editing projects
- `ProjectDeleteButton`: Button with confirmation dialog for deleting projects

#### Task Components

- `ProjectTasks`: Displays a table of tasks for a project
- `TaskForm`: Form for creating and editing tasks
- `TaskActions`: Dropdown menu for task actions (edit, delete)
- `TaskDeleteDialog`: Confirmation dialog for deleting tasks
- `KanbanBoard`: Drag-and-drop interface for managing task statuses

### Pages

We implemented the following pages for project and task management:

- `/dashboard/projects`: Lists all projects
- `/dashboard/projects/new`: Create a new project
- `/dashboard/projects/[id]`: View project details and tasks
- `/dashboard/projects/[id]/edit`: Edit a project
- `/dashboard/projects/[id]/tasks/new`: Create a new task for a project
- `/dashboard/projects/tasks/kanban`: Kanban board view for all tasks

## User Flow

1. User creates a new project from the projects page
2. User views the project details page
3. User adds tasks to the project
4. User can assign tasks to employees
5. User can update task statuses via the Kanban board
6. User can edit or delete tasks and projects as needed

## Security

All server actions include proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access their own data:

- Users can only see and manage their own projects
- Users can only see and manage tasks within their own projects
- Server actions validate that the project/task belongs to the current user before allowing modifications

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the project and task management features:

1. Task filtering and sorting options
2. Task due dates and reminders
3. Task comments and activity logs
4. Project statistics and reporting
5. Team collaboration features
